Mail-Vpostmail version 0.01
===========================

Vpostmail is a CLI-interface to the same system for which Postfixadmin
is a web interface. It provides a Perl module (Mail::Vpostmail), and 
9 scripts which make use of it, aping those provided by Inter7's vpopmail 
virtual mailbox thingy:

 vaddaliasdomain
 vaddaliasuser
 vadddomain
 vadduser
 vdeldomain
 vdeluser
 vdominfo
 vpasswd
 vuserinfo

It's woth noting, however, that they're equivalent in name alone, they're
not a drop-in replacement for use in scripts, see the module for that.

It is tested on, and designed for, a Postfix/Dovecot/MySQL system using
md5crypt for passwords. There's nothing to support PostgreSQL, and I've 
no idea if anything would need changing for Courier.

It is very much a work in progress currently but, it is hoped, better
than nothing.

It is hosted on GitHub, issues and pull requests welcome :)
