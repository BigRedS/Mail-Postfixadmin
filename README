vpostmail
=========

Vpostmail is an attempt to provide the same command line tools as provided in
Vpopmail, but for a Postfix/Dovecot/MySQL environment. Alternatively, it's an
attempt to provide a command-line version of postfixadmin.

Vpostmail.pm is (will be) a module providing the functions, and once that's done
I'll write some scripts. 

Documentation for the module is at 
 http://avi.co/Vpostmail.html

And the scripts to be written are:

vadddomain domain.name
  Create a domain with default settings

vdeldomain domain.name
  Delete a domain

vmoddomain [options] domain.name
  Configure a domain, by passing options to it

vdominfo domain.name
  Get information about a domain

vadduser user@domain.name password
  Create a user, setting the password if supplied

vdeluser user@domain.name
  Delete a user

vpasswd user@domain.name password
  Set a user's password, which may be supplied as an argument, else prompt for it

vuserinfo user@domain.name
  Get information about a user

vmodduser [options] domain.name
  Configure a user by passing options to it
