=head1 NAME

vdeluser - delete a user from the mail system

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is part of Avi's collection of scripts to emulate vpopmail's 
scripts on a Postfix/MySQL system. 

Any feature-parity is purely coincidental.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

vdeluser user@domain.com

=head1 OPTIONS

No.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Delete the user 'user@example.com':

  vdeluser user@example.com

=head1 EXIT STATUS

Exits 0 on success, non-zero on failure. Useful error messages are used 
as a poor substitute for sensible exit statuses.
