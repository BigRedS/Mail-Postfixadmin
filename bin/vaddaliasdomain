Usage:
  vaddaliasdomain [alias] [target]

Alias must not already be an alias domain, but may already 
be configured as a normal domain. In this case it's 
converted into a regular one and nothing is done with its 
mailboxes etc.

The target may or may not exist on this system. A warning 
is printed to stderr if it doesn't exist, but the alias is 
created anyway. I've actually no idea what happens when this 
is the case.

#TODO: work out what happens when the target domain isn't here

=head1 NAME

vaddaliasdomain - add an alias domain to the system

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is part of Avi's collection of scripts to emulate vpopmail's scripts on a Postfix/MySQL system. 
Any feature-parity is purely coincidental.

vaddaliasdomain adds an alias domain such that mail delivered to user@aliasdomain is instead delivered
to user@targetdomain; currently each alias domain may only have one target. 

If the supplied alias is already a domain on the system it is coverted into an alias domain but its mailboxes and other config is left as-is.

The target need not exist on this system, though what the mail system does with matching mail in this instance isn't defined by me.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

vaddaliasdomain <alias domain> <target domain>

=head1 OPTIONS

None.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Add example.net to the system such that all mail for it delivered to the respective user at example.com
 
 vaddaliasdomain example.net example.com

=head1 EXIT STATUS

Exits 0 on success, non-zero on failure. Useful error messages are used as a poor substitute for sensible exit statuses.
