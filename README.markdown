vpostmail
=========

Vpostmail is an attempt to provide the same command line tools as provided in
Vpopmail, but for a Postfix/Dovecot/MySQL environment. Alternatively, it's an
attempt to provide a command-line version of postfixadmin.

Plan is to write a module to do everything that I think I might want to do, 
then the scripts to use them.

This is also My First Module, so going will be slow and unpredictable :)
